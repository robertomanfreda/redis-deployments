- üõ†Ô∏è **Persistence:** Supports RDB snapshots and AOF logging for durability.
- üîÅ **Replication:** Allows master-replica replication for data redundancy.
- üèóÔ∏è **High availability:** Sentinel provides automatic failover for a resilient setup.
- üåç **Clustering:** Enables horizontal scaling via sharding.

## How Redis Works ‚öôÔ∏è

Redis is a high-performance, in-memory key-value store designed for speed and efficiency. Here are some key aspects of
its architecture:

- üöÄ **Single-threaded core:** Redis processes all commands using a single-threaded event loop, avoiding context
  switching overhead and ensuring predictable performance.
- üåã **Blazing-fast operations:** Due to its in-memory nature, Redis achieves sub-millisecond response times for most
  operations.
- üõë **Atomic commands:** All Redis commands are atomic, ensuring that operations are completed in a single step.
- üìù **Data durability options:** Redis supports both RDB snapshots (point-in-time persistence) and AOF (Append-Only
  File) logging for durability.
- üîÑ **Replication & failover:** Redis supports master-replica replication and Sentinel-based automatic failover for high
  availability.
- üîÄ **Sharding for scalability:** Redis Cluster enables horizontal scaling by partitioning data across multiple nodes.

### Single-thread Nature

> ... Another contributing factor is its predominantly single-threaded nature: single-threading avoids race conditions
> and CPU-heavy context switching associated with threads
> @https://redis.io/learn/operate/redis-at-scale/talking-to-redis/redis-server-overview

Redis is primarily **single-threaded**, meaning it handles all operations using a single core. This design choice avoids
race conditions and the overhead caused by context switching between threads, leading to **predictable and fast
performance**.

However, since **Redis 6.0**, **multithreading** has been introduced **only for I/O operations** (e.g., accepting
connections, reading requests, and sending responses). The number of threads for I/O can be configured using the
`io-threads` directive in `redis.conf`, but **the core execution of commands remains single-threaded**.

### **Why Avoid Using Multiple Databases in Redis?**

In Redis, multiple logical databases can be accessed using the `SELECT` command (e.g., `SELECT 1`, `SELECT 2`). However,
using multiple databases is **discouraged** except in very limited cases.

üîπ **Why?**

- Redis still operates with a **single thread** for all databases, meaning that all DBs compete for the same CPU time.
- There is **no real isolation** between databases beyond logical separation.
- Most Redis commands, including `FLUSHDB` and `FLUSHALL`, affect all databases, leading to potential issues in shared
  environments.

Salvatore Sanfilippo, the creator of Redis, has discussed this topic in this conversation:  
üëâ [Google Groups Discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/redis-db/c/vS5wX8X4Cjg)

**Alternative?** ‚úÖ **Use key prefixes instead of multiple databases** (e.g., `user:1001:name`, `order:5001:status`).
This approach is more scalable and recommended for applications needing separation within Redis. üöÄ

### Election, Quorum ...

| Concept                          | Description                                                                       | How to Avoid Issues                                                                    | Example                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Leader Election**              | Process to elect a new leader when the primary fails                              | Use a reliable election mechanism (Raft, Sentinel, Zookeeper)                          | Redis Sentinel automatically promotes a replica to leader               |
| **Quorum**                       | Minimum number of nodes that must agree before an action (e.g., failover) happens | Set quorum to `N/2 + 1` to avoid split-brain scenarios                                 | In a 5-node Sentinel setup, quorum should be `3`                        |
| **Split Brain**                  | When network partitions cause multiple nodes to think they are leaders            | Use fencing tokens, quorum-based voting, or strong coordination                        | Redis Sentinel uses majority voting to decide on leader failover        |
| **Failover Process**             | Automatic promotion of a new leader when the current one is unreachable           | Ensure majority of nodes agree before electing a leader                                | If a primary fails, Sentinel waits for quorum before electing a replica |
| **Avoiding Dual Leadership**     | Prevents two nodes from assuming the leader role simultaneously                   | Use **epoch versions**, fencing mechanisms, and strong consistency models              | Redis Cluster uses `epoch` versions to track leadership history         |
| **Network Partition Handling**   | Ensures that a partitioned leader does not process conflicting writes             | Implement network fencing and majority-based elections                                 | Sentinel ensures that only one partition has enough votes for leader    |
| **Configuration Best Practices** | Proper setup to ensure reliable failover and high availability                    | Set up Sentinel with at least 3 nodes and configure `down-after-milliseconds` properly | `sentinel monitor mymaster 127.0.0.1 6379 2` (where `2` is quorum)      |

- üîó [Redis Cluster - Leader Election](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/reference/cluster-spec/)

‚úÖ **Best Practice:** Always deploy at least **three Sentinel nodes** (or an odd number in cluster setups) to avoid *
*split-brain scenarios** and ensure correct quorum-based leader election. üöÄ

## Caching Patterns üî•

### Cache-aside üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- The application checks Redis for the data first.
- If not present, it queries the database, updates Redis, and returns the data.
- Used for read-heavy workloads with occasional writes.

### Write-through ‚úçÔ∏è

- The application writes data to Redis and the database simultaneously.
- Ensures consistency between Redis and the database.
- Suitable for scenarios where data consistency is critical.

### Write-back ‚è≥

- The application writes to Redis first, deferring database updates.
- Redis periodically flushes updates to the database.
- Improves write performance but may cause temporary inconsistencies.

### Least Recently Used (LRU) Eviction ‚ôªÔ∏è

- Redis automatically removes the least recently used keys when memory is full.
- Helps manage cache size efficiently.
- Can be configured with policies like `volatile-lru`, `allkeys-lru`, etc.

### Time-to-Live (TTL) Expiry ‚è±Ô∏è

- Keys can have an expiration time set.
- Ensures stale data is automatically removed.
- Useful for session storage and temporary caches.

### Distributed Caching üåê

- Multiple Redis instances can be used to distribute cache load.
- Commonly used in large-scale applications with high concurrency.

---

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

Each Redis instance uses its respective `redis.conf` file, located within the `conf` directories.

---

## Data Persistence üíæ

Each Redis instance stores data in the `data/` directory, ensuring persistence across restarts.

### RDB VS AOF

| Feature             | RDB (Redis Database File)           | AOF (Append-Only File)                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Persistence**     | Periodic snapshot of data           | Continuous log of write operations              |
| **Performance**     | Faster, uses fewer resources        | Slower, ensures more data safety                |
| **Durability**      | Risk of data loss between snapshots | Higher reliability with fsync                   |
| **Memory Usage**    | Lower, only stores snapshots        | Higher, logs all operations                     |
| **Recovery Speed**  | Faster (loads a compact file)       | Slower (replays all operations)                 |
| **File Corruption** | More resilient to corruption        | Higher risk if the file is damaged              |
| **Configurability** | Snapshot intervals (`save 900 1`)   | Various sync modes (`fsync always/everysec/no`) |
| **Best Use Case**   | Periodic backup, high speed         | Maximum data reliability                        |
